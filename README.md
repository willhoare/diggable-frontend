This is the repo for the frontend portion of Diggable, a crowd-funding platform specifically targeted at Independent musicians. Diggable aims to help alleviate the financial stress of touring by allowing artists to set a financial goal and offer unique rewards to their fans to help them reach that goal.

This is the Client side/frontend repo only, and should be run in conjunction with the backend repo which can be found at https://github.com/willhoare/diggable-server

This app was built using React, HTML, SASS and Bootstrap. All dependencies will need to be installed by running 'npm i' in the terminal. 
As the React Carousel I am using is deprecated, it may be necessary to run 'npm i --force' instead, if you run into an error on the first try. 
 
 
 Once all dependencies have been installed, run 'npm start' in the terminal in order to launch the development server. 
 
 The server will take you to the homepage of the app which gives an overview of the site and how it works.
